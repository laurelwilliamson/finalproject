Project Overview Requirements:
1- Finding a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing
2- Use ML in the context of technologies learned.
3- Must use Scikit-Learn and or another machine learning library.
4- Must use at least two of the below:
5- Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly, JavaScript D3.js, JavaScript Leaflet, QL Database, MongoDB Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon AWS, Tableau
6- Host application using Heroku.

The project:
- Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.49.1, BootStrap 4.0.0, pandas/Lux, sklearn, Google Maps.

For the model I will use 17 independent variables. The original dataset has 44 variables.
Dependent variable:
Total cup points: Number of points the end product coffee has stored by the CQI jury (1-100 points; 100 is the highest score)

Independent variables:
Country of Origin, Species, Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Clean Cup, Sweetness, Cupper Points, Region, Processing Method, Quakers, Total Cup Points, Altitude mean in meters

Definitions:
Country of origin: Where the coffee comes from
Aroma: Aroma refers to sensations perceived by the olfactory bulb and conveyed to the brain; whether through the nose or retro-nasally: The aromatics of a coffee.
Species: Arabica and Robusta all with different varieties
Processing method: Which method was used to process it before roasting.
aftertaste: Refers to lingering residual sensations in the mouth after coffee has swallowed. It might be distinguished from finish which is the final sensations of the coffee while it leaves the mouth
Quackers - Category one defects: How many cat. 1 defects the coffee has
Category two defects: How many cat. 2 defects the coffee has
Mean altitude (m): At which mean altitude this coffee is cultured
Uniformity: Is refer to one of the particular amount of cups on which you evaluate if elements (acidity, body,etc) shows an stable behavior during the time (time in this case is in a each other slurp in that cup). Cleanness of cup is referred to the consistency of each cup according to it's uniformity.
Body: Associated with and sensed by mouthfeel, how a coffee feels in the mouth or its apparent texture, a tactile sensation.
Flavor: The overall impression in the mouth, including the origin In coffee talk, it refers to a coffee-producing region or country; such as, "I was just at origin." Of course "Origin" for most product we use is not a beautiful farm in a temperate climate, character as well as tastes that come from the roast.: 
This is the overall impression in the mouth, including the above ratings as well as tastes that come from the roast.
Cupper Points: The cupper’s correction is a term we use to measure the “intangible” qualities of a cup: if, for instance, a coffee totals 88 points, but it is high quality enough that we feel it should< be a 90, we add in a +2 cupper's correction.: The cupper's correction is a term we use to measure the "intangible" qualities of a cup: if, for instance, a coffee totals 88 points, but it is high quality enough that we feel it should be a 90, we add in a +2 cupper's correction.
Sweetness: Sweetness is an important positive quality in fine coffees, and is one of five basic tastes: Sour Sour is one of four basic sapid (in the mouth) tastes: Sour, Sweet, Salty, Bitter (and possibly a 5th called Umami which indicates savory flavors). In coffee, sourness in moderate amounts of favorable, although the More , Sweet, Salty Salty is one of four basic sapid (in the mouth) tastes: Sour, Sweet, Salty, Bitter (and possibly a 5th called Umami which indicates savory flavors). In coffee, saltiness is not usually a positive quality, but More , Bittersalty-sweet-sour-bitter Bitterness is one of 5 basic tastes: Sour, Sweet, Salty, Bitter and Umami (savory flavors). 
Total Cup Points: The cupper’s correction is a term used to measure the “intangible” qualities of a cup: if, for instance, a coffee totals 88 points, but it is high quality enough that we feel it should< be a 90, we add in a +2 cupper's correction.: The cupper's correction is a term we use to measure the "intangible" qualities of a cup: if, for instance, a coffee totals 88 points, but it is high quality enough that we feel it should be a 90, we add in a +2 cupper's correction.
Clean Cup: Clean cup refers to a coffee free of taints and defects. It does not imply sanitary cleanliness, or that coffees that are not clean (which are dirty) are unsanitary. It refers to the flavors, specifically the absence of hard notes, fruity-fermenty flavors, earthy Earthy is a flavor term with some ambivalence, used positively in some cases, negatively in others.: Sumatra coffees can have a positive earthy flavor, sometimes described as "wet earth" or "humus" or "forest" flavors. But More flavors or other off notes.
